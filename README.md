# CS5010-FinalProject

In this project we examined NBA basketball data from the last 5 full seasons. Our goal with this project was to create interesting visuals and summaries of the given data that any basketball fan would enjoy regardless of their particular interest level. At the end of our file we allow the user to interact with the program and create their desired visualizations. Some of the main questions we address are: 
 - How have teams trended over the last 5 seasons in terms of wins 
 - What teams have had sustained success over the last 5 seasons in terms of wins 
 - How do all teams compare against each for a given statistic 
 - How has the league in general trended for certain statistics over the last 5 seasons
